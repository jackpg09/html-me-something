                My first time playing disc golf was in 2003. Some friends and I went to Watson Trail Park in Sunset Hills.
                I was givin a simple lightweight Gateway Magic (Putter) to play with for the day. It was not an easy game.
                Regardless, I still had fun just being outside with my friends.

                <p>
                My friends and I decided that we liked the game and wanted to go get our own discs. I wasn't ready to fully commit
                financially so I decided i would buy a simple mid-range disc called an Innova Shark. It was a great multi-purpose disc
                that would be perfect for learning the game. For the next few months we played every chance we could. I would drive with my
                new disc and putt with the old Gateway Magic. Then one day my Shark broke when I threw it against a tree.

                <p>
                My game had gotten much better by the time my Shark broke. I went out to buy a new disc and this time I wanted to get a little more
                serious with my disc selection. I was still quite ignorant of disc types but, I found a fairway driver called a "Banshee" and it
                had a cool color scheme so I decided to make the purchase. I found that the disc was a bit too stable for me at first but, if I threw it sidearm 
                I could muscle it down the fairway nicely. This is how my natural talent for the "Flick" or sidearm was developed. The flick is a shot like a forehand 
                tennis shot. It was once considered an unorthodox throw in the early disc golf years but has become a staple shot in any professional throwers arsenal.

                <h2>Backhand Powergrip</h2>

                <p>
                By the time I was in college I had become a solid forehand driver. I had picked up a few lost discs that I found on different courses and
                added them to my now growing number of discs. I was still just purely a recreational player at this point but my love for the game was growing.
                I decided I needed to learn how to throw a traditional backhand shot if I was ever going to get better. This type of shot is quite different than
                a forehand. A proper backhand shot requires that you turn your back to your target and thus are blind during a portion of your shot. Learning to trust
                my body mechanics and not my eyes was difficult at first but muscle memory eventually prevailed. I was picking up more birdies than ever now that
                I considered myself a full fledged disc thrower. Little did I know that I still had much to learn.

                <h2>Learning To Reach</h2>

                <p>Before I ever learned to reach back when I drove, I had already become quite masterful in many aspects of the game of disc golf.
                I watched my favorite pros playing disc golf and wondered how I could increase my overall distance with my drive. I was still maxing out my drives at
                a mere 350ft. The farthest driving pros on tour can throw twice as far! I knew there was a part of my technique that was missing. I found the secret reachback
                while doing some internet video research. When I attempted to implement this new attribute to my throw it was like adding nitrous oxide to a racecar. I didn't
                know how to handle the new found power. Keeping the disc on the right path was now a delicate task. If I wanted to maintain the precision I had before I would
                need to constantly focus on my footwork and body mechanics. After getting a handle on this new technique I had really started to drop my scores on the course.
                I was now able to play on full size courses with confidence.

                <p>I have been playing disc golf for a long time now and I decided to enter a local tournament in St. Louis city called the Willmore Open. Disc golf is even
                better when played competitively. I went on to get 10th place, which I was very proud of.
